# Development Environment  

## Software Requirements  
### IDE     
- Visual Studio Code  
- Github Codespaces  
- Arduino IDE    
### Programming Languages & Libraries    
- Next.js/Node.js:      Main frameworks for developing the web application.  
- Firebase SDK:         For data storage and real-time database connectivity.  
- Chart.js or Recharts: For creating graphs and charts.  
- Socket.io:            For handling real-time data streaming if needed.
### Database
Firebase: for storing telemetry data. 
### Testing    
Postman: API testing.
