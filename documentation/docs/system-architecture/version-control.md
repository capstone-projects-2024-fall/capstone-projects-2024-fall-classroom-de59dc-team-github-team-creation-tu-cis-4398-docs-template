# Version Control
- Version control will be handled using Git and Github.
- Branches:
  - The Main Branch is protected.
  - Branches require a pull request to be accepted by one other team member before being merged into the main branch.
  - All features get their own individual branch during development.
    - Branches are named after the corresponding ticket number assigned to the issue in Jira.
- Deployment:
  - Before each 'milestone demo' a GitHub release will be made.
  - The Github release will always be created from the Main Branch of the repository.
