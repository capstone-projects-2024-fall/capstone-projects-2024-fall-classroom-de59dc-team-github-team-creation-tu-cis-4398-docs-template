The diagram shows the individual tables and their relations in our MongoDB database. The tables provide this description:

- USER: The user holds the core information for users who participate in quests and guilds. A user can create quests, be part of multiple guilds, and belong to multiple parties.
      - USER (many-to-many with GUILD): A USER can belong to many GUILDs.
      - USER (many-to-many with QUEST): A USER can create many QUESTs, but each quest belongs to one user as the creator.
      - USER (many-to-many with PARTY): A USER can be part of multiple PARTYs.
- AVATAR: represents the avatar created and owned by the user. Each avatar belongs to only one user.
      - AVATAR (many-to-one with USER): One USER can own many avatars.
- QUEST: Contains information about quests. A quest is created by a user and can be assigned to guilds and parties.
      - QUEST (many-to-one with USER): Each QUEST is created by one USER
      - QUEST(many-to-many with GUILD): A QUEST can be assigned to many GUILDs, and each GUILD can have many quests assigned to it.
      - QUEST (one-to-one with PARTY): Each PARTY can be assigned one QUEST, and each QUEST can have one PARTY associated with it.
- GUILD: Represents a group that users can join. A guild can assign quests and have multiple parties inside.
      - GUILD(many-to-many with USER): A GUILD can have many USERs, and each USER can be in many GUILDs.
      - GUILD(many-to-many with QUEST): A GUILD can assign multiple QUESTs, and each quest can be assigned to multiple GUILDs.
- PARTY: Represents a group of users within a guild that works together on a quest. Each part is assigned to one quest and contains several users.
      - PARTY(many-to-many with USER): A PARTY can have many USERs, and each USER can belong to multiple parties.
      - PARTY(one-to-one with QUEST): Each PARTY is assigned to exactly one QUEST.
      - PARTY(many-to-one with GUILD): A PARTY belongs to one GUILD, but a GUILD can have many PARTYs.
- GUILD_PARTY: A subset of parties within a guild. Similar to the party entity but specific to the guild.
      - GUILD_PARTY(many-to-many with USER): A GUILD_PARTY can have many USERs inside it, and each USER can be part of multiple guild parties.
      - GUILD_PARTY(one-to-one with QUEST): A GUILD_PARTY is assigned to exactly one QUEST.
