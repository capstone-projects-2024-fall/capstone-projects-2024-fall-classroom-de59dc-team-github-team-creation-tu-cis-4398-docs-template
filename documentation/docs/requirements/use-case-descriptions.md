# Use-case descriptions

## Case 1
A race crew is testing their vehicle with their driver to make sure the car is performing well.     
1. Crew connects device to the electrical control unit (ECU).    
2. Driver gets into vehicle and ensure the device is turned on.    
3. Crew ensures data is being updated to monitors.    
4. Driver drives.    
5. Engine temperature starts to climb above normal operating range.   
6. Device relays temperature data to the crew.   
7. Device sends alert to driver and crew.   
8. Crew determines temperature is climbing too fast, tells driver to come into pit.    
9. Crew discovers a crack in the radiator/coolant leak.   
10. Crew replaces the radiator.   
11. Driver and crew retest.   

 

## Case 2 
A car enthusiast wants to tune their car to increase horsepower. 
1. Driver installs the device, connects it to the ECU. 
2. Driver opens monitor/UI for the program. 
3. Driver changes values in ECU for air-fuel ratio (richer) and ignition timing (faster). 
4. Driver drives. 
5. Device stores data for later analysis. 
6. Driver looks for horsepower readings in stored data. 
7. Driver adjusts ECU values as needed. 
8. Driver tests and repeats. 


## Case 3 
A commuter wants to save some gas for their daily driver. 
1. Driver installs the device, connects it to the ECU. 
2. Driver opens monitor/UI for the program. 
3. Driver changes values in ECU for air-fuel ratio (leaner). 
4. Driver drives. 
5. Device stores data for later analysis. 
6. Driver adjusts ECU values as needed. 
7. Driver tests and repeats. 


## Case 4 
You are Takumi, a teenager in Japan who delivers tofu for your father. To keep your customers satisfied, you must drift through the winding mountain roads at break neck speeds. Yes, this is “Initial D”. Or maybe you are already a professional drifter. 
1. Takumi installs the device in his sexy Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86. 
2. Takumi opens up his computer and accesses the UI of the device. 
3. An absolute mad man, he disables his Electronic Stability Control so he can make those sweet drifts. 
4. Takumi takes the nastiest corners that anyone has ever seen, absolutely smoking other drivers. 
5. Takumi is reincarnated as the immortal Drift King. 
 

## Case 5 
Ian Applebaum is a weekend racer. It’s been a few months since he decided to go to the track, but he notices that his acceleration is a bit rough. The engine sounds uneven, potentially indicating that car has a timing issue. This can cause damage to the vehicle, so Ian decides to check his timing. Ian decides to work on it in the garage. 
1. Ian installs the device into his vehicle. 
2. Ian opens his computer and accesses the device UI. 
3. Ian test drives his car. 
4. Ian accesses his timing data from the past couple months where there were no issues. 
5. Ian compares it with the most recent, problematic timing data. 
6. Ian attempts to fix problem by using old timing values to replace the new ones. 
7. Ian test drives the vehicle. 
8. The issue is still persistent which suggests that it may be a mechanical issue. 
9. Ian notices that the timing belt is frayed and coming off. He reverts the data as that was not the issue. 
10. Ian is able to buy a new belt for $200 and does not have to pay for a mechanic to get it fixed. 
11. Ian takes his significant other for a date with the saved labor costs. 

## Case 6
A driver is racing in Monaco, but there seems to be an issue. He has been driving for some time and notices that his fuel gauge is indicating that it is still full. Knowing that this cannot be correct, he radios his team about the issue.
1. Team installs the device.
2. Crew checks and maintains the vehicle. Everything is OK.
3. After the race starts, no issues are detected for the first 30 minutes.
4. Driver looks at his fuel gauge and notices it is indicating the tank is full. Needle is stuck.
5. Driver radios the pit crew about this issue. 
6. Team cross checks fuel levels with the live data being transmitted.
7. Team confirms with the driver that he is low on fuel and needs to make a pit stop whenever possible.
8. Driver relies on fuel readings from the team and completes race.

## Case 7
A driver is getting ready for a race. It is known that tires perform better when hot.
1. Team installs device.
2. Team checks the tire temperature and notices that it is too cold for optimal performance.
3. Before the driver comes up to the starting line, he starts making zig zag patterns to increase friction and heat.
4. Team notifies the driver that the optimal temperature has been achieved and to head to the starting line.
5. Driver goes to starting line and race begins shortly.

## Case 8
A driver and his team decide that they must push their lead and floor it. This in turn causes the tires to increase in temperature too much and cause damage to the tires. The team gets a reading that the temperature of the tires have reached above safe levels. The crew tells the driver to come in for a pit stop and tire change.
1. Team installed device.
2. Race starts.
3. Driver takes lead and wants to capitalize. He floors it and lengthens the gap between him and his competitors.
4. The crew watching the tire temperature readings notice that the temperatures are almost at dangerous levels.
5. Team initiates pit stop and driver comes in.
6. Crew installs fresh tires.
7. Driver continues race.
