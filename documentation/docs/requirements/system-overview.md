# System Overview

## Project Abstract

Devs and Dragons is a multiplayer web-based application that's designed as a gamified learning platform for Computer Science students. Users can form parties of two to four members to tackle quests involving coding challenges. Team members take turns solving problems within a time limit determined by the selected difficulty level. Quests and their coding problems are generated and graded by a GPT bot based on user(s) input, problem type, difficulty, and quest description.


## High Level Requirements

### Group Dynamics
- **Party:** Small group of 2 to 4 members.
- **Create Room:**  User can create a quest and invite others to join by sharing a unique room code.
- **Join Room:**  User can join an existing quest by entering the shared room code.

### Game Mechanics

**Figure 1.**
**Timed Challenge:** The party is given a set amount of time (based on the selected difficulty) to solve each problem. The amount of time is divided equally among the party members.

**Turn-based coding:** Each party member takes turns writing code by picking up where their party members left off. If the answer is incorrect after cycling through all of the party, then the party loses health. The timer restarts and the member who went first will start again. This repeats until the party fixes their solution to solve the problem, or the party's health reaches zero (which means the party lost).

### Grading User Input
- GPT grades user(s) input.
- GPT grading does not start until all members have taken a turn.
- GPT ensures and verifies correct logic is used to solve problems. E.g., for a problem which the solution is 10, GPT will not accept a function with a one liner being "return 10" (for the answer).
- GPT rates answers from 1 to 5 stars, based on a 10-point grading scale:
  - **1 star**: Rating of 0% - 30% signfies a solution which is extremely inefficient, irrelevant, or incorrect.
  - **2 stars**: Rating of 40% – 50% signifies a solution which is generally inefficient, partially helpful, but still unclear or incomplete.
  - **3 stars**: Rating of 60% to 70% signifies a solution which is efficient clear, relevant, and generally complete.
  - **4 stars**: Rating of 80% to 90% signifies a solution which is highly efficient and exceeds expectations.
  - **5 stars**: Rating of 100% signfies an exceptional and perfect solution.

### Quest Creation
All users can create a quest by filling out a form that specifies the difficulty, number of problems, topic of problems (Computer Science related), enemy, and background.

### Starting a Quest
In multiplayer mode, the user must be in a party of two or more people in order to start a quest made by the user. The user who created the quest can provide a unique code for others to join the quest.

## Conceptual Design
The frontend of Devs and Dragons is developed using React.js to build UI components and manage the application state. The backend is powered by Flask, handling user authentication, API requests, and integrating with the OpenAI GPT model for generating and grading coding challenges. The MongoDB database stores the user data, quest configurations, and coding submissions. WebSockets manage the multiplayer connections to allow players to collaborate in real-time during quests. 

## Background
Educators often face the challenge of addressing differences in students’ preparedness, as coding experience can vary widely among those entering a computer science program. This diversity makes it difficult to teach in a way that is engaging and effective for everyone. Additionally, the importance of soft skills, particularly teamwork and collaboration, can be hard to implement when some students may feel discouraged due to many students choosing to work alone or within their circle. Devs and Dragons addresses these challenges by combining the multiplayer dynamic of video games with the rigor of programming challenges. By fostering a collaborative environment, the platform not only aims to aid individual learning but also enhances group problem-solving skills.
