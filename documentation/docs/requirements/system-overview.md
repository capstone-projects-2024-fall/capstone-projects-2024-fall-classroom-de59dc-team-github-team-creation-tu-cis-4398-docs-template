# System Overview

## Project Abstract 

This document proposes a wireless vehicle telemetry system to transmit real-time data from a Formula-style racecar to devices off the track. The system will allow racing teams to view important sensor and diagnostic information - e.g., RPM, lap times, engine temperature - on their devices while up to 500 meters away. Having live data will help to facilitate assessment of driver and vehicle performance on dynamic testing days, preserve engine health through live diagnostics, and promote a deeper team-wide understanding of the vehicle. 

 

One side of the proposed system is the mobile component, consisting of the hardware embedded into the vehicle’s wiring (primarily a microcontroller and wireless internet service provider) and the software to run the server side of the system. The client side consists of devices that connect to the vehicle’s network to display data in a webpage. The final product is a web page that enables users to view live racecar data in the form of customizable widgets for graphs, gauges, and warnings.  

 

This project is intended for use in Temple Formula Racing’s (TFR) vehicle, which competes in the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) competition. In this competition, university teams are challenged to design, fabricate, and race formula-style vehicles.
