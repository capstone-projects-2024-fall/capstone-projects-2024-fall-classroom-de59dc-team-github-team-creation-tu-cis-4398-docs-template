# System Overview
# Project Abstract

The AI Study RPG Organizer will use the Canvas API and ChatGPT to streamline the assignment process and enhance student engagement through gamification of coursework. This application is catered to students who often struggle with organizing, prioritizing, and finishing assignments. The software will integrate Canvas API  by gathering students’ assignments, deadlines, and coursework details. Once all of this data has been collected, it will then pass information to ChatGPT to classify, and help prioritize specific assignments. The AI will sort assignments based on different criteria such as difficulty, due dates, and the amount of effort to complete an assignment. The difficulty will be calculated by the length of the due date for the assignment and effort required to finish a task. 

What makes this app unique is the gamification aspect for canvas assignments. The app will turn task completion into an RPG gaming experience. Students can change the theme of the map (pirate, fantasy, or club penguin) to create and customize their avatars, gain experience points and in-game currency (gold), buy gear for aesthetic purposes, and unlock achievements by completing assignments on time. This can help students stay organized and also transforms studying into a more engaging and enjoyable process.


# Conceptual Design 

The app will be available for both Android and iOS. We will be using React to build the app. The app will use the Canvas API for Single Sign-On, enabling students to easily create accounts and log in using their institution’s login credentials. There will be a dashboard upon login. Students will be greeted with a customizable dashboard. The dashboard will offer the ability to personalize the layout and theme for the gameplay; not only that, but students can also navigate through different sections such as Assignments, Study Progress, Gear/Inventory, and view current tasks, deadlines, and progress at a glance. Python will power the backend, managing user interactions, data processing, and integration with external APIs. Another technology that will be utilized is SQL, SQL will be used to store student-related data, including their avatar's gear, experience points, achievements, and progression within the RPG game. Students will have an avatar that can earn XP by completing assignments, unlock new gear that could drop randomly by again, completing assignments, or purchase it through the shop. There will be achievements based on their academic performance and task completion. As the app evolves, new features like study groups, competitive leaderboards, and in-app study challenges could be added to enhance both individual and group motivation.


# Background

To differentiate from an existing platform like Habitica, we are trying to push the gamification aspect even further and focus specifically on helping students achieve educational goals. The main goal is to be more immersive and deepen engagement while maintaining a focus on academic productivity. Instead of simple lists, each assignment could be part of an evolving quest where the student can freely move around the map and talk to an NPC to start an assignment. Borrowing the foundation from traditional RPGs, students can choose an avatar class like (Scholar, Strategist, Alchemist) with unique skill trees. skill trees are paths that characters can progress through to earn additional skills and points. Completing tasks not only earns XP but also specific skills related to their class. This introduces deeper RPG mechanics where academic progress influences gameplay. This is necessary for "boss battles" which represent larger or difficult assignments. Students can earn customizable gear that directly influences their avatar’s strength in the game. The leveling system can be tied directly to long-term academic growth, encouraging students to not only complete tasks but also reflect on their learning progress. For example, completing tasks on a consistent schedule might unlock advanced or rare gears. Ultimately, the Study RPG Game Organizer app offers a more immersive, engaging, and adaptive experience than Habitica, deeply integrating academic tasks with RPG gameplay for long-term motivation and productivity.
