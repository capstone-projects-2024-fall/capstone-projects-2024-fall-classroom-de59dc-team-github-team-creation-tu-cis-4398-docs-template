# System Overview

## Project Abstract
	This web-based platform will assist job seekers in interview preparation through dynamic means of practicing coding problems. With this application, users will have an interactive learning experience wherein they describe problems using a stylus or touch input on tablets and state their reasons verbally. This system uses AI technologies that have been applied to review the user's problem-solving approach, provide real-time guidance for more complex questions, and assess the precision and clarity of the user's answers. This comprehensive feedback mechanism not only refines key skills necessary for successful job interviews but also enhances a user's ability to perform under real-world conditions, preparing job seekers technically while coaching them to articulate their thoughts clearly and effectively.

## Conceptual Design

	The frontend will be handled with HTML5, to render drawings and input using the implementation of the Canvas API or SVG. Node.js will be used for the backend, to handle API requests and real-time communication by using WebSocket. Flask or Django will be used for the incorporation of AI/ML components, such as handwriting recognition and natural language processing.
  
## Background
	
	There are existing products such as [MockAI](https://mock-ai.com/home#home-function-href) and [Final Round AI](https://www.finalroundai.com/) that have similar functionalities. These platforms are designed to enhance interview preparation through AI-driven simulations. MockAI focuses on creating coding interviews that provide real-time feedback, allowing for performance analysis to help users improve their skills. Final Round AI offers a set of tools including real-time transcription and personalized support based on industry-specific scenarios. Whiteboard Assist aims to utilize AI technologies to prepare users for interviews. However, this software introduces features like handwriting recognition, which aims to simulate a interview environment that particularly for roles requiring technical demonstrations or extensive problem-solving discussions, thus preparing users effectively for both digital and in-person interactions.
