#### Figure 1. High-level design of the WhiteboardFlow application.
    Figure 1 provides an overview of the WhiteboardFlow application architecture. Users interact with the system via mobile devices, using a stylus or touch input to simulate a whiteboard experience. The front-end, built with React (HTML5 and JavaScript), handles the user interface, enabling whiteboard drawing with the Canvas API or SVG. The backend, developed in Node.js, manages API requests and real-time communication. AI/ML components, powered by TensorFlow or PyTorch, process handwriting recognition and solution analysis, while natural language processing (NLP) using NLTK or spaCy evaluates verbal inputs. Firebase securely stores user data, progress, and question banks, while user authentication is managed through Single Sign-On (SSO) with Facebook or Google. Feedback and guidance are displayed in real-time on the user's device, enhancing the learning experience.
