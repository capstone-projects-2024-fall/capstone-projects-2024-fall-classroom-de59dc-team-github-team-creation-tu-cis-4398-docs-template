# Introduction

Canvas Quest will streamline the assignment process and enhance student engagement through gamification of coursework. This application is catered towards students who often struggle with organizing, prioritizing, and finishing assignments.

The software will integrate Canvas API by gathering studentsâ€™ assignments, deadlines, and coursework details from Canvas. Once all of this data has been collected, it will then pass information to our website allowing users to have an overview of their assignments, and help prioritize specific assignments. Users will have the ability to sort assignments based on different criteria such as difficulty, due dates, and the amount of effort to complete an assignment. The difficulty will be calculated by the length of the due date for the assignment and effort required to finish a task.

What makes this app unique is the gamification aspect for canvas assignments. The app will turn task completion into an RPG gaming experience. The theme of the game is set in a fantasy world of edo period Japan where players can gain experience points and in-game currency (gold), buy gear for their character, and build up the world by completing assignments on time. This can help students stay organized and also transforms studying into a more engaging and enjoyable process.
