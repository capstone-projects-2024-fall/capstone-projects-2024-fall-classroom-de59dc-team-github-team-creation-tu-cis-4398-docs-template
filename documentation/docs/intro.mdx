# Introduction
At the highest levels of motorsports, F1 crews rely on accurate and timely information from the car and its systems. Just like any other sport where the smallest margins matter, data analysis has become a staple
of Formula 1 racing. Every second, there is a mountain of data that is being produced and read by the computers in the vehicle. Anything from fuel levels, tire pressure, tire temperature, speed, RPM, suspension data,
G-Forces, the list goes on and on.
<br /><br />The software and sensors that are often used are prohibitively expensive for the hobbyist. Our implementation of wireless telemetry is meant to be freely available while still providing the user 
with timely, accurate information for a fraction of the price. We hope to contribute to the racing community of all skill sets so everyone can obtain maximum performance from their vehicles. Even if you are a hobbyist that does 
not have access to a crew, you will be able to easily read all the data and make the changes you deem necessary.
