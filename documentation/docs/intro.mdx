# Introduction

Devs and Dragons is a web application that gamifies learning for computer science students by turning coding challenges into interactive quests.
Problems are solved in single or multiplayer mode, with quests tailored by user input and a GPT bot. Correct code damages the enemy while mistakes reduce the playerâ€™s health. 
In multiplayer mode, players collaborate in turn-based challenges to solve problems. Get ready to customize quests, tackle coding problems, and test skills against the clock!
