## Project Abstract

Devs and Dragons is a multiplayer web-based application that's designed as a gamified learning platform for Computer Science students. Users can form parties of two to four members to tackle quests involving coding challenges. Team members take turns solving problems within a time limit determined by the selected difficulty level. Quests and their coding problems are generated and graded by a GPT bot based on user(s) input, problem type, difficulty, and quest description.

## High Level Requirement

### Group Dynamics
- **Party:** Small group of 2 to 4 members.
- **Create Room:**  User can create a quest and invite others to join by sharing a unique room code.
- **Join Room:**  User can join an existing quest by entering the shared room code.

### Game Mechanics

**Figure 1.**
**Timed Challenge:** The party is given a set amount of time (based on the selected difficulty) to solve each problem. The amount of time is divided equally among the party members.

**Turn-based coding:** Each party member takes turns writing code by picking up where their party members left off. If the answer is incorrect after cycling through all of the party, then the party loses health. The timer restarts and the member who went first will start again. This repeats until the party fixes their solution to solve the problem, or the party's health reaches zero (which means the party lost).

### Grading User Input
- GPT grades user(s) input.
- GPT grading does not start until all members have taken a turn.
- GPT ensures and verifies correct logic is used to solve problems. E.g., for a problem which the solution is 10, GPT will not accept a function with a one liner being "return 10" (for the answer).
- GPT rates answers from 1 to 5 stars, based on a 10-point grading scale:
  - **1 star**: Rating of 0% - 30% signfies a solution which is extremely inefficient, irrelevant, or incorrect.
  - **2 stars**: Rating of 40% â€“ 50% signifies a solution which is generally inefficient, partially helpful, but still unclear or incomplete.
  - **3 stars**: Rating of 60% to 70% signifies a solution which is efficient clear, relevant, and generally complete.
  - **4 stars**: Rating of 80% to 90% signifies a solution which is highly efficient and exceeds expectations.
  - **5 stars**: Rating of 100% signfies an exceptional and perfect solution.

### Quest Creation
All users can create a quest by filling out a form that specifies the difficulty, number of problems, topic of problems (Computer Science related), enemy, and background.

### Starting a Quest
In multiplayer mode, a party of two or more users are needed in order to start a multiplyer (or "Two Player") quest. The user who created the quest can provide a unique code for others to join the quest.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
